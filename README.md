Note: This is a work in progress, but should work.

A custom component that integrates Q-Sys Core Devices with Home Assistant via [QRC](https://q-syshelp.qsc.com/Index.htm#External_Control_APIs/QRC/QRC_Overview.htm). This is useful to expose elements such as gain controls, mute buttons and different media players to HA.

### Features

- `media_player` platform:
    - [Media Stream Receivers/ URL Receivers](https://q-syshelp.qsc.com/Index.htm#Schematic_Library/URL_receiver.htm)
        - On/Off (Enable/Disable)
        - Mute control
        - Volume control (stereo channels)
        - Browse media
        - Play media

- `number` platform:
    - `Value` controls (e.g gains)
        - Direct control (setting Value directly)
        - Position control (0.0 to 1.0)
        - Custom mapping via templated changes/values.

- `sensor` platform:
    - `EngineStatus` exposed to HA
    - Any component control

- `switch` platform:
    - Any float/int/bool where 1.0/1/True is considered on respectively
    - Toggling.

- `text` platform:
    - `String` controls.

- `services`:
    - Invoking methods on the device via QRC (see `Services` section below)

### Installing

Add the custom component via your `custom_components` folder or via HACS (untested).

#### Via HACS

1. Install HACS
1. Open HACS in the sidebar and go to "Integrations".
1. Press the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
1. Fill in the form with `Repository: https://github.com/nkvoll/home-assistant-qsys-qrc`, `Category: Integration` and click "Add".
1. Once it's added, you can search for `q-sys qrc`, click the integration and select "Download".
1. Restart Home Assistant ("Settings" -> three dots top right corner -> "Restart Home Assistant")
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Devices & Services" click "+ Add Integration" (bottom right corner) and search for "Q-Sys QRC Integration"

#### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `qsys_qrc`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/qsys_qrc/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant ("Settings" -> three dots top right corner -> "Restart Home Assistant")
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Devices & Services" click "+ Add Integration" (bottom right corner) and search for "Q-Sys QRC Integration"

### Configuring

First, set up the integration through the UI to configure the core name and credentials.

To expose component controls to HA, configure them via the configuration file (`configuration.yaml`).

See [the example configuration](examples/configuration.yaml) for an example of what can be configured.

### Services

### `call_method` Service

Used to call any method via [QRC Commands](https://q-syshelp.qsc.com/Index.htm#External_Control_APIs/QRC/QRC_Commands.htm):

#### Example: setting a gain control:

```yaml
service: qsys_qrc.call_method
data:
  method: Component.Set
  params:
    Name: bathroom_f2_gain
    Controls:
      - Name: gain
        Position: 0.5
        Ramp: 2
target:
  device_id: 7b7be23f1d37293589c28bee4dbb5b4d
```

#### Example: setting a mute control:

```yaml
service: qsys_qrc.call_method
data:
  method: Component.Set
  params:
    Name: bathroom_f2_gain
    Controls:
      - Name: mute
        Value: true
target:
  device_id: 7b7be23f1d37293589c28bee4dbb5b4d
```


### TODO

- Add tests, see [`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component) to get started.
- Add brand images (logo/icon) to https://github.com/home-assistant/brands.
- Create a releasee.
- Share the integration on the [Home Assistant Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/).
- Submit the integration to the [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/start).
- Verify audio player works in practice as HA media players.
- Anything else?
